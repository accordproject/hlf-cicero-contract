# hlf-cicero-contract

This project is a generic Smart Contract for **Hyperledger Fabric v2.2 (HLF v2.2)** (aka chaincode) that can be used to install, instantiate and trigger clauses within a smart legal agreement, defined using the [Accord Project](https://accordproject.org) technology. The logic for the clause runs on-chain, and responses from the logic are returned to the caller. Any emitted events are passed to the Fabric event bus, and the state for the clause is stored on-chain.

The smart contract is initialized using an Accord Project *CiceroMark* document. CiceroMark is an extended markdown format, allowing inline instantiation of [Accord Project templates](https://docs.accordproject.org/docs/accordproject.html).

# Install

## Quick Install Setup [Method-1]

Tested for Ubuntu 18.04 and above. Thus can work for any debian based distribution.

```
mkdir hlf-cicero-setup
cd hlf-cicero-setup
git clone https://github.com/accordproject/hlf-cicero-contract.git
cd hlf-cicero-contract
./setup.sh
source ./path.sh
./initialize.sh
./trigger.sh
```

## Install Setup [Method-2]

### Fabric Install
Refer to the [HLF documentation](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/install.html) for how to install the HLF v2 Test-Net and how to start it.

### Set HLF_INSTALL_DIR

```
export HLF_INSTALL_DIR=/Users/dselman/dev/fabric-samples
```

### jq Install
Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) for your platform.

### Set PATH

Ensure your path is set correctly so that the `peer` command works. E.g.

```
export PATH=/Users/dselman/dev/fabric-samples/bin/:$PATH
peer version
```

### Start Network **with CA**

Start the network by running the `./network.sh down && ./network.sh up -ca` inside the `fabric-samples/test-network` directory.

### Create the Channel

Don't forget to create the channel (see the Fabric install guide and check you did not miss this step)!

```
./network.sh createChannel
```

### Install Cicero Chaincode

Install the package onto Hyperledger Fabric v2 Test-Net peers using the `./install.sh` script.

Here are the logs from a successful installation.

## Deploy a Smart Legal Contract

After installing the chaincode on the peers you **must** call the `initialize` method by running the `./initialize.sh` script.
The script deploys `contract.md` to Fabric, which contains a simple `HelloWorld` clause.

> During the initialize transaction the CiceroMark text is parsed to extract the template references and templates are downloaded from https://templates.accordproject.org. This logic will have to be customized to load templates from elsewhere.

## Trigger

Once instantiated clauses within the smart contract can be triggered by running the `./trigger.sh` script to submit `request.json` to trigger CLAUSE_001.

Here are the logs from 2 calls to trigger a stateful clause. Note the integer value `Hello Dan Selman Hello(1.0)` gets incremented each time the clause is triggered, with state stored on the HLF ledger.

First run:

```
*** Result: {"$class":"org.accordproject.helloworldstate.MyResponse","output":"Hello Fred Blogs Dan(1.0)","transactionId":"2aed5ebdc2378ee9907a6d4ed888cc6f6ff6967d2e41c630a5ead32681bbdcf7","timestamp":{"seconds":{"low":1599680419,"high":0,"unsigned":false},"nanos":543000000}}
```

Second run:

```
*** Result: {"$class":"org.accordproject.helloworldstate.MyResponse","output":"Hello Fred Blogs Dan(2.0)","transactionId":"bfcd66b77c24329017e6bb500637cede10d22f42f7e4942809261caf813b0def","timestamp":{"seconds":{"low":1599680425,"high":0,"unsigned":false},"nanos":768000000}}
```

# Deploying Another Contract

To deploy a different contract and trigger it (rental-deposit) use the following commands:

```
cd client
node submitTransaction.js initialize rental-contract.md
node submitTransaction.js trigger rental-request.json RENTAL_001
```

You can experiment with different contracts by simply adding a smart legal contract markdown file and the request JSON file to use and then re-running `node submitTransaction.js initialize` and `node submitTransaction.js trigger` with the appropriate arguments.

# Rebuild and Redeploy

To modify the smart contract you must increment the version number in `package.json` and re-run the `./install.sh` script. Because you can only initialize the contract once you will have to tear-down the network (or comment out the body of the `ensureNotInitialized` smart contract method).

To restart the Test-Net run `./network.sh down && ./network.sh up -ca && ./network.sh createChannel` from within the Test-Net directory.
